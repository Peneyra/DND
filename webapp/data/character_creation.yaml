        "As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, 
        and remarkable resilience."
      short and stout: >
        "Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, 
        miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand 
        well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact 
        that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two 
        feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a 
        match for any of the larger folk. \n  Dwarven skin ranges 
        from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the 
        most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like 
        certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in 
        simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though 
        paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value 
        their beards highly and groom them carefully."
      long memory, long grudges: >
        "Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the 
        oldest living dwarves often remember a very different 
        world. This longevity grants them a 
        perspective on the world that shorter lived races such as 
        humans and halflings lack. \n  Dwarves are solid and 
        enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the 
        passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little 
        change. They respect the traditions of their clans, 
        tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most 
        ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don't 
        abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions 
        is devotion to the gods of the dwarvers, who uphold the 
        dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and 
        devotion to the forge.  \n  Individual dwarves are 
        determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in 
        action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many 
        dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow 
        to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one 
        dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf's entire clan, so what 
        begins as one dwarf's hunt for vengeance can become a 
        full-blown clan feud."
