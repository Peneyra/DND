          Rage: 'In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren''t wearing heavy armor: you have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws; when you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian (see the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table); you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. If you are able to cast spells, you can''t cast them or concentrate on them while raging. Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven''t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. You can rage twice per long rest at 1st level. This increases at higher levels.'
          Unarmored Defense: 'While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.'

            so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other
            than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature
            gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. Once within the next 10
            minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to
            one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The
            creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use
            the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says
            whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die
            is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic
            Inspiration die at a time. You can use this feature a number of times
            equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any
            expended uses when you finish a long rest. Your Bardic Inspiration
            die changes as you level: 1st level: d6, 5th level: d8, 10th level:
            d10, 15th level: d12.'

            the two-handed or heavy property. While unarmed or wielding
            only monk weapons and you aren''t wearing armor or shield then
            (1) You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and
            damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons. (2) You can
            roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or
            monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in
            the Martial Arts column of the Monk Table. (3) When you use the
            Attafck action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your
            turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For
            example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarter-
            staff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action,
            assuming you haven''t already taken a bonus action this turn.'

            any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not
            behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead)
            of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the
            vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same
            radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has
            been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell. You can
            use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma

            of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With
            that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to
            your paladin level x 5. As an action, you can touch a creature to
            restore any number of hit points remaining in the pool.
            Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of
            healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison
            affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize
            multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit
            points separately for each one. This feature has no effect on

Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies. You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them. When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all. You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.'
          Natural Explorer: 'You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in. While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits: difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel; your group can’t become lost except by magical means; even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger; if you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace; when you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would; while tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area. You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.'

The amount of extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class.'
          ThievesCant: 'During your rogue training you learned thieves'' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves'' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly. You also understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves'' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.'

    traits:
      breath weapon: 'You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your  draconic
        ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage  type of the exhalation. \n
        When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area  of the exhalation
        must make a saving throw, the type of  which is determined by your draconic
        ancestry. The DC for  this saving throw equals 8 + your constitution modifier
        +  your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a  failed save,
        and half as much damage on a successful one.  The damage increases to 3d6
        at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level,  and 5d6 at 16th level.'
      damage resistance: 'You have resistance to the damage type associated with
        your  draconic ancestry.'
      draconic ancestry: 'You have draconic ancestry. Choose one type of dragon from  the
        Draconic Ancestry table. Your breath weapon and damage  resistance are determined
        by the dragon type, as shown in  the table.'
    size: 'Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing  well over 6
      feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your  size is Medium.'
    speed: 'Your base walking speed is 30 feet.'
    age: 'Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after  hatching, attain
      the size and development of a 10-year-old  human child by the age of 3, and
      reach adulthood by 15. They  live to be around 80.'
    alignment: 'Dragonboarn tend to extremes, making a concious choice for  one
      side or the other in the cosmic war between good and  evil (represented by
      Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively). Most  dragonborn are good, but those who
      side with Tiamat can be  terrible villains.'

      hill dwarves: 'As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition,  and
        remarkable resilience.'
      long memory, long grudges: 'Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old,
        so the  oldest living dwarves often remember a very different  world. This
        longevity grants them a  perspective on the world that shorter lived races
        such as  humans and halflings lack. \n  Dwarves are solid and  enduring like
        the mountains they love, weathering the  passage of centuries with stoic endurance
        and little  change. They respect the traditions of their clans,  tracing their
        ancestry back to the founding of their most  ancient strongholds in the youth
        of the world, and don''t  abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those
        traditions  is devotion to the gods of the dwarvers, who uphold the  dwarven
        ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and  devotion to the forge.  \n  Individual
        dwarves are  determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in  action,
        sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many  dwarves have a strong sense
        of justice, and they are slow  to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong
        done to one  dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf''s entire clan, so what  begins
        as one dwarf''s hunt for vengeance can become a  full-blown clan feud.'
      short and stout: 'Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors,  miners,
        and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand  well under 5 feet tall,
        dwarves are so broad and compact  that they can weigh as much as a human standing
        nearly two  feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a  match
        for any of the larger folk. \n  Dwarven skin ranges  from deep brown to a
        paler hue tinged with red, but the  most common shades are light brown or
        deep tan, like  certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in  simple
        styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though  paler dwarves often have
        red hair. Male dwarves value  their beards highly and groom them carefully.'

    age: 'Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they''re  considered young
      until they reach the age of 50. On average,  they live about 350 years.'
    alignment: 'Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits  of a

      of fair play and as belief that everyone  deserves to share in the benefits
      of a just order.'

      Drow: Descended from an earlier subrace of elves, the drow were  banished
        from the surface world for following the goddess  Lolth down the path of evil.
        Now they have built their own  civilization in the depths of the Underdark,
        patterned after  the Way of Loth. Also called dark elves, the drow have skin  that
        resembles charcoal or obsidian, as well as stark white  or pale yellow hair.
        They commonly have very pale eyes (so  pale as to be mistaken for white) in
        shades of lilac,  silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to be smaller and  thinner
        than most elves.
