        Rage: 'In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren''t wearing heavy armor: you have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws; when you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian (see the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table); you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. If you are able to cast spells, you can''t cast them or concentrate on them while raging. Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven''t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. You can rage twice per long rest at 1st level. This increases at higher levels.'
        Unarmored Defense: 'While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.'

          gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. Once within the next 10
          minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to
          one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The
          creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use
          the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says
          whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die
          is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic
          Inspiration die at a time. You can use this feature a number of times
          equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any
          expended uses when you finish a long rest. Your Bardic Inspiration
          die changes as you level: 1st level: d6, 5th level: d8, 10th level:

          the two-handed or heavy property. While unarmed or wielding

          damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons. (2) You can
          roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or
          monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in
          the Martial Arts column of the Monk Table. (3) When you use the
          Attafck action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your

        divine sense: 'The presence of strong evil registers on your senses
          like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in
          your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such
          forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of
          any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not
          behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead)
          of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the
          vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same
          radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has
          been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell. You can
          use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma
          modifier. When you finish a long rest you regain all expended uses.'
        lay on hands: 'Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool
          of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With
          that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to
          your paladin level x 5. As an action, you can touch a creature to
          restore any number of hit points remaining in the pool.
          Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of
          healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison
          affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize
          multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit
          points separately for each one. This feature has no effect on
          undead and constructs.'

        Favored Enemy: 'Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy. Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies. You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them. When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all. You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.'
        Natural Explorer: 'You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in. While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits: difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel; your group can’t become lost except by magical means; even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger; if you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace; when you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would; while tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area. You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.'

Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies to gain this benefit.'
        Sneak Attack: 'Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe''s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don''t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn''t incapacitated, and you don''t have disadvantage on the attack roll. The amount of extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class.'
        ThievesCant: 'During your rogue training you learned thieves'' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves'' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly. You also understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves'' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.'
