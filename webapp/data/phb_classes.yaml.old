  description:
    a life of danger: Not every member of a tribe is suited for the life of a barbarian.
      Only those who possess the will and the fury to become true warriors rise to
      the call. A few barbarians become outcasts, wandering far from their homeland
      to find their own purpose. These warriors are often drawn to adventuring, both
      by the promise of danger and the bonds they forge in battle. Though rough around
      the edges, barbarians are often the heart of their adventuring parties.
    barbarian: A tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard, draped in fur and
      hefting his axe. He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who dared poach
      his people's elk herd. A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority
      over their savage tribe and is answered with a headbutt. As she is knocked to
      her knees, a deep fire burns in her eyes. A barbarian is defined not just by
      their fury, but by their incredible resilience and feats of strength.
    primal instinct: People of towns and cities take pride in how civilized they are,
      in their rich history, their refined manners, their grand art, and their complex
      politics. Barbarians have no use for all that. Their rage burns in their hearts.
      It grants them superhuman strength, speed, and toughness. Barbarians are comfortable
      in nature and prefer their own tribal customs over the laws and codes of civilization.
      They might rise in defense of their people or hunt down whatever threats arise.

        Rage: 'In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter
          a rage as a bonus action. While raging, you gain the following benefits
          if you aren''t wearing heavy armor: you have advantage on Strength checks
          and Strength saving throws; when you make a melee weapon attack using Strength,
          you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as
          a barbarian (see the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table); you have
          resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. If you are able
          to cast spells, you can''t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.
          Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious
          or if your turn ends and you haven''t attacked a hostile creature since
          your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on
          your turn as a bonus action. You can rage twice per long rest at 1st level.
          This increases at higher levels.'
        Unarmored Defense: While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals
          10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a
          shield and still gain this benefit.

bard:
  description:
    bard: "Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient monument in a long-forgotten\
      \ ruin, a half-elf in rugged leathers finds knowledge springing into her mind,\
      \ conjured forth by the magic of her song\xE2\u20AC\u201Dknowledge of the people\
      \ who constructed the monument and the mythic saga it depicts. A stern human\
      \ warrior bangs his sword rhythmically against his scale mail, setting the tempo\
      \ for his war chant and exhorting his companions to bravery and heroism. The\
      \ magic of his song fortifies and emboldens them. Laughing as she tunes her\
      \ cittern, a gnome weaves her subtle magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring\
      \ that her companions\xE2\u20AC\u2122 words will be well received. Whether scholar,\
      \ skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire\
      \ allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal\
      \ wounds."
    learning from experience: "True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel\
      \ singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering\
      \ the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural\
      \ talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the\
      \ difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard's life\
      \ is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living\
      \ on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth\
      \ of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart\
      \ from their fellows. Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and\
      \ their natural desire to travel\xE2\u20AC\u201Dto find new tales to tell, new\
      \ skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon\xE2\u20AC\u201Dmakes\
      \ an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity\
      \ to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover\
      \ lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter\
      \ exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand.\
      \ A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns\
      \ renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes\
      \ accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume\
      \ heroic roles themselves."
    music and magic: In the worlds of D&D, words and music are not just vibrations
      of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of
      song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was
      spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes
      of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The
      music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven
      into their spells and powers. The greatest strength of bards is their sheer
      versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their
      magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards
      are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic
      to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions
      rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge
      of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well.
      Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from
      musical performance to esoteric knowledge.

          To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other
          than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains
          one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature
          can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack
          roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls
          the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide
          before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration
          die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration
          die at a time. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
          Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when

  description:
    cleric: "Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer on his lips, an elf\
      \ begins to glow with an inner light that spills out to heal his battle-worn\
      \ companions. Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe \xE2\u20AC\u02DC\
      \xE2\u20AC\u02DCin wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs arrayed against\
      \ him, shouting praise to the gods with every foe's fall. Calling down a curse\
      \ upon the forces of undeath, a human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from\
      \ it to drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions. Clerics are intermediaries\
      \ between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as\
      \ the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities.\
      \ No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic,"
    divine agents: Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric.
      Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their
      gods' will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms.
      In some places, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping
      stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god
      at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies. When a cleric takes up an
      adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing
      the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization,
      smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also
      expected to protect their deities' worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging
      orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would
      allow a demon prince to enter the world. Most adventuring clerics maintain some
      connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might
      ask for a cleric's aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.
    healers and warriors: Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the
      gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power,
      manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don't grant this power to everyone
      who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling. Harnessing
      divine magic doesn't rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic
      prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion
      and an intuitive sense of a deity's wishes. Clerics combine the helpful magic
      of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes.
      They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call
      down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will
      benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training
      to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.

  description:
    druid: Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf summons the fury
      of the storm and calls down explosive bolts of lightning to smite the torch-carrying
      orcs who threaten her forest. Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in
      the form of a leopard, a human peers out of the jungle at the strange construction
      of a temple of Evil Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the cultists' activities.
      Swinging a blade formed of pure fire, a half-elf charges into a mass of skeletal
      soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the mocking
      semblance of life. Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating
      the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature's resilience,
      cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves
      as extensions of nature's indomitable will.
    power of nature: "Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other\
      \ magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity.\
      \ Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature\
      \ rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature,\
      \ animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes\
      \ called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.\
      \ Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals\xE2\u20AC\u201Dthe power\
      \ of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the\
      \ ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of\
      \ this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural\
      \ form."
    preserve the balance: "For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The\
      \ four elements that make up a world\xE2\u20AC\u201Dair, earth, fire, and water\xE2\
      \u20AC\u201Dmust remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over\
      \ the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental\
      \ planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults\
      \ of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.\
      \ Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains\
      \ plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony\
      \ with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in\
      \ nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such\
      \ as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires).\
      \ Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters\
      \ encroach on the druids\xE2\u20AC\u2122 territory. Druids are often found guarding\
      \ sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant\
      \ danger arises, threatening nature\xE2\u20AC\u2122s balance or the lands they\
      \ protect, druids take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers."

  description:
    fighter: "A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield before her as she runs\
      \ toward the massed goblins. An elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor,\
      \ peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The half-orc\
      \ nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault\
      \ to the best advantage. A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between\
      \ the ogre's club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion,\
      \ a half-elf in scale armor swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she\
      \ circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses. A gladiator fights\
      \ for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling\
      \ foes and moving them around for the crowd's delight\xE2\u20AC\u201Dand his\
      \ own tactical advantage. His opponent's sword flares with blue light an instant\
      \ before she sends lightning flashing forth to smite him. All of these heroes\
      \ are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of\
      \ DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. Champion knights, conquering overlords, royal enforcers,\
      \ elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings\xE2\u20AC\u201D\
      as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor,\
      \ and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted\
      \ with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face."
    trained for danger: "Not every member of the city watch, the village militia,\
      \ or the queen's army is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively untrained\
      \ soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military\
      \ officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are fighters.\
      \ Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon\
      \ delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers\
      \ is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or\
      \ she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards\xE2\
      \u20AC\u201Dfew fighters in the city watch have the opportunity to discover\
      \ a magic flame tongue sword, for example."
    well-rounded specialists: Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every
      fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword,
      use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise,
      a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree
      of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some
      concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some
      on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general
      ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields
      and in dungeons alike.

  description:
    monk: Her fists a blur as they deflect an incoming hail of arrows, a half-elf
      springs over a barricade and throws herself into the massed ranks of hobgoblins
      on the other side. She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and sending
      them reeling, until at last she stands alone. Taking a deep breath, a human
      covered in tattoos settles into a battle stance. As the first charging orcs
      reach him, he exhales and a blast of fire roars from his mouth, engulfing his
      foes. Moving with the silence of the night, a black-clad halfling steps into
      a shadow beneath an arch and emerges from another inky shadow on a balcony a
      stone's throw away. She slides her blade free of its cloth-wrapped scabbard
      and peers through the open window at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the
      grip of sleep. Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability
      to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled
      as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability
      and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.
    the magic of ki: "Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic\
      \ traditions call ki. This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the\
      \ multiverse\xE2\u20AC\u201Dspecifically, the element that flows through living\
      \ bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects\
      \ and exceed their bodies\xE2\u20AC\u2122 physical capabilities, and some of\
      \ their special attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their opponents. Using\
      \ this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes.\
      \ As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of ki gives\
      \ them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes."
    training and asceticism: "Small walled cloisters dot the landscapes of the worlds\
      \ of D&D, tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand\
      \ still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation\
      \ and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live\
      \ there when their parents died, when food couldn't be found to support them,\
      \ or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families.\
      \ Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from\
      \ anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation,\
      \ emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader,\
      \ a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power. The majority of monks\
      \ don\xE2\u20AC\u2122t shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby\
      \ towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As\
      \ versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters\
      \ or tyrants. For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured,\
      \ communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and\
      \ monks don\xE2\u20AC\u2122t undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters\
      \ take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests\
      \ of their physical and spiritual growth. As a rule, monks care little for material\
      \ wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely\
      \ slaying monsters and plundering their treasure."

          unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or shield
          then (1) You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage
          rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons. (2) You can roll a d4 in
          place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die
          changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of
          the Monk Table. (3) When you use the Attafck action with an unarmed strike
          or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus
          action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarter-
          staff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you
          haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.
        unarmored defense: While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield,
          your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.

paladin:
  description:
    beyond the mundane life: Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring
      life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for
      a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against
      evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of
      the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When
      they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations
      and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service
      of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty
      is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country. Adventuring
      paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt
      can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure.
      Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against
      it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.
    paladin: "Clad in plate armor that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and\
      \ grime of long travel, a human lays down her sword and shield and places her\
      \ hands on a mortally wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands, the\
      \ man\xE2\u20AC\u2122s wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.\
      \ A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible\
      \ in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory.\
      \ Silently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two orcs are\
      \ dead before they even realize he is there. Silver hair shining in a shaft\
      \ of light that seems to illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation.\
      \ His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant,\
      \ until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness. Whatever their origin\
      \ and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the\
      \ forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god's altar and the witness of a priest,\
      \ in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of\
      \ desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin\xE2\u20AC\
      \u2122s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout\
      \ warrior into a blessed champion."
    the cause of righteousness: "A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness,\
      \ to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness,\
      \ and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus\
      \ on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the\
      \ oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins\
      \ are devoted to gods of good, a paladin\xE2\u20AC\u2122s power comes as much\
      \ from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god. Paladins train\
      \ for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and\
      \ armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they\
      \ wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead,\
      \ and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight for justice."

      traits:
        divine sense: The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a
          noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.
          As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the
          end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or
          undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the
          type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense,
          but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance).
          Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object
          that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell. You can
          use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier.
          When you finish a long rest you regain all expended uses.
        lay on hands: Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing
          power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can
          restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5. As
          an action, you can touch a creature to restore any number of hit points
          remaining in the pool. Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your
          pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison
          affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons
          with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each
          one. This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

  description:
    deadly hunters: "Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the\
      \ monsters that threaten the edges of civilization\xE2\u20AC\u201Dhumanoid raiders,\
      \ rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They\
      \ learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through\
      \ the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat\
      \ training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific\
      \ favored foes. Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire\
      \ the ability to cast spells that harness nature's power, much as a druid does.\
      \ Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the\
      \ hunt. A ranger\xE2\u20AC\u2122s talents and abilities are honed with deadly\
      \ focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands."
    independent adventurers: "Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide,\
      \ or a tracker, a ranger's true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization\
      \ from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild.\
      \ In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic\
      \ circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing\
      \ that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first\xE2\
      \u20AC\u201Dand possibly the last\xE2\u20AC\u201Dline of defense. This fierce\
      \ independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed\
      \ to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred\
      \ adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers\
      \ respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they\
      \ quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight\
      \ against civilization\xE2\u20AC\u2122s foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled\
      \ city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the\
      \ wild, but they make up for it in other ways."
    ranger: Rough and wild looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees,
      hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a
      shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy
      after another. After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds
      her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging
      off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath,
      she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon's thick
      scales. Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles
      high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in
      Elvish, he points to the owlbear he's been tracking and sends the hawk to distract
      the creature while he readies his bow. Far from the bustle of cities and towns,
      past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the
      wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty
      plains, rangers keep their unending watch.

  description:
    a shady living: "Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live\
      \ up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins,\
      \ cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves'\
      \ guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even\
      \ they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists.\
      \ A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators,\
      \ which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats\xE2\u20AC\u201Dand\
      \ wererats\xE2\u20AC\u201Dhaunt the sewers. As adventurers, rogues fall on both\
      \ sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune\
      \ in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from\
      \ the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose\
      \ of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure."
    rogue: "Signaling for her companions to wait, a halfling creeps forward through\
      \ the dungeon hall. She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of\
      \ tools and picks the lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into\
      \ the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the door open. A human\
      \ lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part\
      \ in the ambush. When their target\xE2\u20AC\u201Da notorious slaver\xE2\u20AC\
      \u201Dpasses the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate,\
      \ and the assassin's blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound. Suppressing\
      \ a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers and magically lifts the key ring from\
      \ the guard's belt. In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is\
      \ open, and she and her companions are free to make their escape. Rogues rely\
      \ on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in\
      \ any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any\
      \ problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone\
      \ of any successful adventuring party."
    skill and precision: Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety
      of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad
      expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth
      and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment,
      such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks. When it comes
      to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather
      make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target
      most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost
      supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement
      their other abilities.

        Expertise: At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of
          your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your
          proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either
          of the chosen proficiencies. At 6th level, you can choose two more of your
          proficiencies to gain this benefit.
        Sneak Attack: Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit
          a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to
          one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack
          roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don't need advantage
          on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it,
          that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack
          roll. The amount of extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class.
        ThievesCant: During your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret
          mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly
          normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands
          such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than
          it does to speak the same idea plainly. You also understand a set of secret
          signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages such as whether
          an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot
          is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide
          a safe house for thieves on the run.

sorcerer:
  description:
    raw magic: Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit
      with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that
      springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others
      carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests
      in unexpected ways. The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable.
      Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but
      in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time,
      the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can't name
      the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their
      own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby's birth,
      or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery.
      So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces
      of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner
      workings of reality. Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes
      of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their
      spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic,
      they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.
    sorcerer: Golden eyes flashing, a human stretches out her hand and unleashes the
      dragonfire that burns in her veins. As an inferno rages around her foes, leathery
      wings spread from her back and she takes to the air. Long hair whipped by a
      conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting
      him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, through him,
      and out from him in a mighty blast of lightning. Crouching behind a stalagmite,
      a halfling points a finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs
      from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation
      with a grin, unaware that her wild magic has turned her skin bright blue. Sorcerers
      carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some
      otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can't study
      sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary
      life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.
    unexplained powers: Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it's unusual to find
      a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with
      magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn't like
      to stay quiet. A sorcerer's magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency
      to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn't called on. Sorcerers often have
      obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater
      understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery
      of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its
      full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an
      adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in
      their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know.

    delvers into secrets: Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge
      and power, which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. This
      thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later careers as well.
      Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely known. But many
      warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds
      comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles
      into a pact without being fully aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over
      tomes of forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student's mind is opened to
      realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the
      outer void. Once a pact is made, a warlock's thirst for knowledge and power
      can't be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such
      a mighty patron if he or she doesn't intend to use the power thus gained. Rather,
      the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit of their goals,
      which typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of
      their patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.
    sworn and beholden: "A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being.\
      \ Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric\
      \ and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not\
      \ gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil,\
      \ or an utterly alien entity\xE2\u20AC\u201Dbeings not typically served by clerics.\
      \ More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and\
      \ an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional\
      \ services performed on the patron's behalf. The magic bestowed on a warlock\
      \ ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock's being (such as\
      \ the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful\
      \ spells. Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some\
      \ facility at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light armor and know\
      \ how to use simple weapons."
    warlock: With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young elf in golden robes
      smiles warmly, weaving a magical charm into his honeyed words and bending the
      palace sentinel to his will. As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened
      human whispers the secret name of her demonic patron, infusing her spell with
      fiendish magic. Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the odd alignment
      of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling chants the mystic ritual that will
      open a doorway to a distant world. Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that
      lie hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts made with mysterious
      beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and
      spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey nobles,
      demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together
      arcane secrets to bolster their own power.

    scholars of the arcane: Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power
      of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become
      like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell
      requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and
      sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely
      hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours
      of study. Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary.
      They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also
      learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from
      ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.
    the lure of knowledge: Wizards' lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard
      is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a
      library or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other
      wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue
      lives of crime or domination. But the lure of knowledge and power calls even
      the most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories
      and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts
      in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages,
      and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than
      any magic available in the present age.
    wizard: Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an elf closes her eyes
      to shut out the distractions of the battlefield and begins her quiet chant.
      Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a tiny
      bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a conflagration that
      engulfs the soldiers. Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes an intricate
      magic circle in chalk on the bare stone floor, then sprinkles powdered iron
      along every line and graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones
      a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, bringing a whiff
      of brimstone from the otherworldly plane beyond. Crouching on the floor in a
      dungeon intersection, a gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with
      mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over them. Closing his eyes to
      see the visions more clearly, he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points
      down the passage to his left. Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united
      as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that
      permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning,
      subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures monsters
      from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns slain foes into
      zombies. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors
      down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.
