acolyte:
  description:
    acolyte: You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god
      or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy
      and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order
      to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily
      a cleric performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine
      power. Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from
      among those listed in appendix B or those specified by your DM, and work with
      your DM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary
      in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites?
      Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god
      in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any
      established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish
      master that you now deny.

  traits:
    shelter of the faithful: As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share
      your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You
      and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care
      at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you
      must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your
      religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle. You might also
      have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and
      you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve,
      if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new
      home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance,
      provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good
      standing with your temple.
charlatan:
  description:
    charlatan: You have always had a way with people. You know what makes them tick,
      you can tease out their hearts' desires after a few minutes of conversation,
      and with a few leading questions you can read them like they were children's
      books. It's a useful talent, and one that you're perfectly willing to use for
      your advantage. You know what people want and you deliver, or rather, you promise
      to deliver. Common sense should steer people away from things that sound too
      good to be true, but common sense seems to be in short supply when you're around.
      The bottle of pink-colored liquid surely cures that unseemly rash, this ointment
      not more than a bit of fat with a sprinkle of silver dust restores youth and
      vigor, and there's a bridge...

      standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform

      other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential
      patrons, allies, or hirelings. Guilds often wield tremendous political power.
      If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can
      be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access
      to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good
      standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items

  traits:
    discovery: The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you access to a
      unique and powerful discovery. The exact nature of this revelation depends on
      the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos, the
      deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or the forces of nature. It
      could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact
      that has long been forgotten, or unearthed some relic of the past that could
      rewrite history. It might be information that would be damaging to the people
      who consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.
      Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact
      on the campaign.

      know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it.
      Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or
      a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge
      you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply

      for yourself and your adventuring companions. You might sail on the ship you
      served on, or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps one captained
      by a former crewmate). Because you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain
      of a schedule or route that will meet your every need. Your Dungeon Master will

      a standing national army or a mercenary company, or perhaps a member of a local

      work with your DM to determine which military organization you were a part of,
      how far through its ranks you progressed, and what kind of experiences you had
      during your military career. Was it a standing army, a town guard, or a village
      militia? Or it might have been a noble's or merchant's private army, or a mercenary

      watch over you or to provide for you, so you learned to provide for yourself.
      You fought fiercely over food and kept a constant watch out for other desperate
      souls who might steal from you. You slept on rooftops and in alleyways, exposed
      to the elements, and endured sickness without the advantage of medicine or a
      place to recuperate. You've survived despite all odds, and did so through cunning,
      strength, speed, or some combination of each. You begin your adventuring career
      with enough money to live modestly but securely for at least ten days. How did
      you come by that money? What allowed you to break free of your desperate circumstances
