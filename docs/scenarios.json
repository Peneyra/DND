To avoid suspicion, Astrid plans to keep the warehouse inactive for a month before slowly integrating the items into the market. She dismissed local workers, replacing them with a controlled labor force, and coerced a minor police official to provide unmarked security personnel. Despite these measures, suspicions have risen due to the presence of unfamiliar guards and laborers. Shipments continue to arrive and be stored regularly, keeping the warehouse bustling with activity while remaining closed to outsiders. Should the operation be discovered, the Trade Consortium risks severe penalties, including confiscation of goods, financial sanctions, and loss of influence. The dismissed dockworkers and locals remain wary of the activity, with their frustration growing as the warehouse operates in secrecy."
